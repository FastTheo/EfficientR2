# Making R Code Efficient

--

+ Hands-on Case Study in
   + Understanding other people's code
   + Making it work
   + Making it efficient

--

+ Meta-programming
   + Programmatically querying the code.
   + Programming on the language.
   + The code is the dataset.

--

+ Focus on the thought process, evolution.
   + not just the technical details.

---
# Context of Code

+  Optimal release of warm and cold water from a reservoir, impacting
   fish populations down-stream and avoiding excessive water in rainy seasons and
   droughts in dry periods.

+ Many thanks to Dr. Lauren Adams for sharing the problem and code.

---
# Starting point

+ Git repository [https://github.com:dsidavis/EfficientR2.git](https://github.com:dsidavis/EfficientR2.git)

+ R script [BIG.R](https://github.com:dsidavis/EfficientR2/BIG.R)

+ Examine it and discuss it with your neighbor about initial thoughts.

--

+ What else do you need to run this code?

--

+ What are the next steps you would take to make it work? faster?

---
# Running the Code

+ Will get an error and stop.

--

  + Fix and start again
--

  + Iterative and can take a long time to reach the error.

--

+ Better approach?

--

+ Can read the code, but doesn't scale when the code is large.

--

+ Static code analysis.
  + Programmatically query code
  + Even modify it programmatically.

---
# Data/External Files

--

+ Find what data files the script requires.

--

+ CodeDepends
```r
info = getInputs(readScript("BIG.R"))
unlist(sapply(info, function(x) x@files))
```

```
       [1] "climateinputs5probs.csv"     ""
       [3] "TwopoolAlldatav4.csv"        "GroupidExpectedVwVcTcTw.csv"
```

--

+ Alternatively, more precisely, find all calls to functions we know read files:
```{r}
library(rstatic)
ast = to_ast(parse("TOY2.R"))
k = find_nodes(ast, function(x) is(x, "Call") && is(x$fn, "Symbol") &&
                                              x$fn$value %in% ReadFiles)
sapply(k, function(x) sapply(x$args[sapply(x$args$contents, is, "Character")], `[[`, "value"))
```


---
# Clearing the Global Environment

+ `rm(list = ls())`

+ Not a good idea as removes any existing variables:
  + including any functions we define
  + data we collected in other, separate computations
  + removing any `trace()` actions we register.

+ Remove only the variables this script creates.


---
# `setwd()`

+ Calls to setwd() in script.

+ Purpose is to move to a directory so can read a file.
```{r}
setwd("C:/Users/leadams/Desktop/ShastaDam/Input_data")
climate = read.csv("climateinputs5probs.csv")
```
+ Uses path that is only on the author's machine.
  + Not portable to another machine/user.

+ Use relative paths under this directory.

+ Symbolic links


---
# Unused Computations

+ Some expressions in script create variables that are never used.
   + Waste of time.

+ How to identify these?
  + CodeDepends

```{r}
info = getInputs(readScript("BIG.R"))
```

---
# Functions

+ What are the functions defined in the script file?

+ Move them to a separate file.
  + Why?

+ How do we know we got them all?

[functions_orig.R](functions_orig.R)


---
# Script or Functions

+ Should we focus on the script or the functions?

---
# Relationships between Functions.
+ Which functions call which other functions.
   +  The Call Graph

+ 
```{r}
fns = sourceFuns("functions_orig.R")
```

+ What functions does the script call?
```{r}
library(rstatic)
p = parse("TOY2.R")
kalls = find_nodes(pa, is, "Call")
pa = to_ast(p)
intersect(sapply(kalls, function(x) x$fn$value), names(fns))
```

---
# Testing Changes

+ We are going to make extensive changes to the code.
   + Need to make certain we continue to get the same results.

--
+ Compare `Best` variable to version from original code.

+ Also other variables created in the script.

+ Also all versions of top-level variables when they are created.

+ See `storeEval()` in CallCounter.

---
# Testing Functions

+ How do we test function give the same results?

--
+ How do we generate test cases.
  + That test the code as they are actually called

--
+ Capture actual calls as they occur in running the script.

--
+ Can manually add code to each function.

+ Instead, use trace() to programmatically add the code.

--
+ Collect
   + actual arguments
   + values of global variables used by
   + return value.

---
# collectCallResults()

```
source("functions_orig.R")
fns = sourceFuns("functions_orig.R")
callFns = lapply(names(fns), collectCallResults)
names(callFns) = names(fns)
source("TOY2.R")
calls = lapply(callFns, function(f) f())
```

+ Problem with the prep functions used in Vectorize() calls.
+ We're tracing them, but get no calls.
+ Need to trace the version in the function created by Vectorize()
   + not the one in the global environment.

```
tmp = environment(v)$FUN
ff = collectResults(tmp)
environment(v)$FUN = tmp
```
+ Non-standard evaluation in `trace()`.

---
# Testing Function Calls

+ Use the results from collectCallResults

+ testFunCall() calls a versoion of the functioncompares the 

---
# Call Information

+ Number of calls
+ length/dimension of arguments in each call


---
# Profiling

+ `Rprof()` is the key tool for our improvements
```{r}
Rprof("tmp.prof")
source("TOY2.R")
Rprof(NULL)  # stop collecting the information
```

+ Generates information about the time spent in each function.

+ `summaryRprof()` to read it back into R
```r
p = summaryRprof("tmp.prof")
head(p$by.self, 20)
```

# Profiling
    
+ Tells us which functions to focus on.

+ Doesn't tell us how many calls there are to each function
  + Just total time in that function.
    
    
---
# Count the Number of Calls to a Function

+ How do we do this?

--
+ Action on each call to a function

+ `trace()` function

+ give an expression or a function to evaluate or call
  + either at start, end or particular expression in function.

---
# CallCounter Package

+ `countMCalls()` to count the number of calls to one or more functions.

+ Also want the length/dimension of each argument
   + `gatherArgInfo()`

+ And to test changes to functions, need
   + actual arguments
   + values of global variables used by
   + return value.

+ `collectCallResults()` for each function.
   + Expensive in memory and also time.
   + `testFunCall()` for the results.

+ call stack history 

---
# Vectorize()

+ How many of you know the Vectorize() function?

--
+ What does it do?

--
+ loop over elements of the arguments, passing one value from each argument
  to target scalar function

+ Uses mapply() to loop
  + Hence `mapply()` in profile table.
  + also `do.call()`

+ Can we do better?
   + Oh yeah!

---
# Vectorize

+ Consider finalinflow and finalinflowprep

```{r}
finalinflowprep=function(month,Q){ 
  monthlyQ=ifelse(month == "January"|| month=="March"|| month=="June"||
                  month=="July" ||month=="August"||month=="October" ||
                  month=="December", 
                  Q*1.98*31, 
                  ifelse(month=="February", 
                         Q*1.98*28,
                         Q*1.98*30))
  return(monthlyQ)
}

finalinflow=Vectorize(finalinflowprep)
```

+ `finalinflowprep()` is a scalar function, but so close to being vectorized

---
# Vectorize()

+ Change || to | and can handle scalar values for month.

+ But also repeats code
  + `Q*1.98* ..`

+ Can move this out
   ```
   Q*1.98*ifelse(....)
   ```

+ So now need to compute the number of days in each month.

+ Rather than `ifelse()`, just use a named-vector.
```
MonthDays = c("January" = 31, "February" = 28, "March" = 31, "April" = 30,
              "May" = 31, "June" = 30, "July" = 31, ...)
Q * 1.98* MonthDays[month]
```

+ finalinflow = finalinflowprep
  + No Vectorize().

+ Create MonthDays once outside of function.

+ Found a simple bug with June and May reversed.

---
# [.data.frame

+ Consider `TaLookup`
```{r}
LookupTable[which((LookupTable[, 1] == VC) & (LookupTable[, 2] == VW)), 3]
```

--
+ First - remove the unnecessary `which()`.

--
+ 3 calls to [.data.frame

+ Can be expensive as handles lookup by row name, index, logical vector, ...

+ Instead, let's use [[ ]]
```{r}
LookupTable[[3]][ (LookupTable[[1]] == VC) & (LookupTable[[2]] == VW) ]
```

+ Faster.

---
# Two-way Table Lookup

From ReleaseTemp()
```{r}
LookupTable[[3]][ (LookupTable[[1]] == VC) & (LookupTable[[2]] == VW) ]
```

Want to be able to vectorize in VC and VW


```{r}
TaLookupprep=function(month,p){
  Ta=Lookupy[which(Lookupy[,1]==month & Lookupy[,2]==p),4] 
  return(Ta)
}
```

+ Remove unnecessary assignment
  + just return the value.
```{r}
TaLookupprep=function(month,p)
  Lookupy[which(Lookupy[,1]==month & Lookupy[,2]==p),4] 
```

+ How to vectorize in month and p?


---
# Focusing on the Script

+ Time the expressions in the TOY2.R script.

+ One stands out as taking the most amount of time.
   `for(S in (NoofStages-1):2){`

+ This has 4 nested loops!

+ Consider
```
  for (r in 1:length(Rdecs)){
    for (v in 1:length(Vstates)){
      Rcaccumstar[v,r]=ifelse(is.na(isaccum[v,r]), NA, 
                              Rcstar[which(Vcstates==Vcoutdirect[v,r] & Vwstates==Vwoutdirect[v,r]),S+1]
      )
      Rwaccumstar[v,r]=ifelse(is.na(isaccum[v,r]), NA, 
                              Rwstar[which(Vcstates==Vcoutdirect[v,r] & Vwstates==Vwoutdirect[v,r]),S+1]
    }
   }
```

+ How do we improve this?

---
# Improvements

+ We recompute several expressions
  + `is.na(isaccum[v,r])`
  + `which()`
  + `Vcstates==Vcoutdirect[v,r] & Vwstates==Vwoutdirect[v,r])`
  + `S+1`

+ Use a single if()

+ Can we reduce the number of iterations in the loop?

---
# Improvements (2)

+ Loop only over the elements/cells for which `isaccum` is NA.
   + Is this common or rare?

+ `rows = which(is.na(isaccum), TRUE)`
  + Gives us the row, columns of cells.

+ Then `for(i in rows)`


---
# Inlining Values

+ Consider TaLookup again
```{r}
TaLookup = function(month, p) 
                   LookupyTa[ as.character(month), as.character(p) ]
```

+ It has a global variable `LookupyTa`
+ Each time we call this, R has to find this variable.

+ If `LookupyTa` never changes after `TaLookupprep`
  is first called, we can put the value of this variable
  directly into the function.
  + We *do NOT* want to add *the code* that creates LookupyTa
    into the function. That would mean recomputing it in each  call
    and also complicate where it is created in TOY2.R.
    Instead, we want to take the already existing object and insert it
   in place of the variable name `LookupyTa`.

+ Constant propogation.

---
# Inlining Values ctd.
```{r}
body(TaLookup)[[2]]
class(body(TaLookup)[[2]])   # name
body(TaLookup)[[2]] = LookupyTa
```

+ Then the function prints as
```{r}
function (month, p) 
c(-5.2, 0.3, 1.2, 3.4, 5.9, 5, 1.3, 0, -2.7, -5.9, -6.9, -4.5, 
0, 3.5, 3.8, 0.9, 6.4, -1, 9, -1.8, -2.8, -6.9, -3.9, -5.1, -0.8, 
-0.7, 4.3, 1.2, 1.9, 9.2, 3.9, -1.7, -2.7, -6, -6.3, -3.9, 1.2, 
0.3, 1.1, 2.3, 7.7, 4, 2.6, -0.1, -2.8, -5.1, -6.8, -4.1, 3.7, 
1.2, 0, 5.9, 0.2, 10, 3.1, 0.1, -3.1, -5.9, -6.4, -3.7)[as.character(month), 
    as.character(p)]
```

+ NOTE:  If we did this after we've optimized all the functions, we wouldn't
  see much gain. This is because we dramatically reduce the number of calls
  to TaLookup (and many others) and so the cumulative cost of the lookup is much smaller.


---
# Repeating the Same Computations

+ Consider
```{r}
Jelly=function(RT){
      ifelse(7.74007 + 0.88836*RT < 30,
             0,
             7.74007 + 0.88836*RT)
}
``` 

+ Computing same thing in `test` and `no` arguments.
   + `7.74007 + 0.88836*RT`

+ Compute once and assign
```{r}
Jelly=function(RT){
      tmp = 7.74007 + 0.88836*RT
      ifelse(tmp < 30, 0, tmp)
}
```
---
# `ifelse()`

+ For `Jelly` function, ifelse() is doing too much and so slower than necessary.

+ Can use `pmax(7.74007 + 0.88836*RT, 0)`

+ Or, more generally,
```{r}
Jelly=function(RT){
    ans = 7.74007 + 0.88836*RT
    ans[ans < 30] = 0
    ans
}
```

+ How do we find these cases?
  + Find all cases
```{r}
fns = sourceFuns("functions.R")
lapply(fns, find_nodes(f) find_nodes(to_ast(f), function(x) is(x, "Call") && x$fn$value == "ifelse"))
```

+ More generally, find arbitrary expression/computation that is repeated
  + without intervening changes to any inputs
  + See rstatic.
