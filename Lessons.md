# Process
+ Use instrumentation tools
+ Use meta-programming
+ Use version control so you can see the history of your changes
  + Commit small changes so you don't lose changes/activities.
+ Profile code


# Techniques
+ Vectorize functions  
+ Follow the profiling data
+ Don't use Vectorize(), ifelse() unless you know they are the right thing
   + or just temporarily
+ ifelse() and NAs require thinking and understanding.
   + Can be very useful, but also confusing.
+ 2-way tables and indexing by 2 column matrices
